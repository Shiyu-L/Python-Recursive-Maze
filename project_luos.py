#Summary: This program create a random maze using recursion and stack in python and used the Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to 
#find the shortest path from the starting point to the ending point including the keys along the way. 
#The starting point is red, it can be in any coordinate.
#The ending point is green and is always on the edge.
#The key is yellow
#Inorder to show the pathway clearly, the brown pathway is from the starting point to the key and the black pathway is from the key to the ending point 

class MyStack:
'''Create a class Stack that implements the regular operations of a stack. It is used for both building the maze and exploring
for the shortest path in the maze because both requires recursion to keep track of the cells visited and to back-track to 
previously visited cells when a deadend is reached'''

class Maze:
    '''
    The class Maze generates a maze and build the shortest path in the maze. In the case of building the maze, the cells in
    the maze that originally all have intact walls are pushed onto the stack and a wall between the current cell and a 
    neighbor is randomly taken down to create different paths. If the cell is at the boarder or have no neighbors with intact 
    walls then cells are poped off the stack to back up until another neighbor is available with intact walls. In the case for 
    exploring the shortest path, every cell along the path is kept track of until the path hits a deadend, at that point cells
    are poped off which means the path backs up until there is another path available and the stack also makes sure any visited
    paths will not be visited again. The shortest path will also include a key which must be pickted up to finish the maze.
    The generated maze is a N+2 by N+2 maze so that each side of the maze has an invisible boarder made up by cells to avoid 
    tedious special cases with boarderline cells.
